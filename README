This my fork of RepRapPro's multi-colour/multi-material
slicer (http://reprappro.com).


Download and installation
=========================

Prerequisites:
 * java    (download from oracle.com)
 * java3d  (download from oracle.com)
 * maven   (download from apache.org)

To compile and run the software simply clone, run maven and execute the script
reprap:
 $ git clone git://github.com/holgero/RepRapProSlicer.git
 $ cd RepRapProSlicer

User Documentation

For details of how to use this software, see http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapPro_Slicer


Upgrades
======== 
As described at http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapPro_Slicer_Variables when you first run this software it creates a copy in your space of all its configuration files.  If you later download upgrades from Github, your configurations will not be overwritten.  That way, if you make adjustments, you keep them from one upgrade to the next.

All the configuration files are placed in a directory called .reprap in your home directory on your computer (note that the initial "." in the name means that this directory is hidden - you have to enable the viewing of hidden files to see it).

If you decide you want to revert your configuration to the standard one, then rename the .reprap directory to, say, .reprap.old then run the software.  It will now not find .reprap, and so it will create you a new .reprap containing copies of the standard files from your download.

One thing you may well want to preserve even if you do this is the offsets of the heads in your Tricolor RepRap that you have set - these are unique to your machine.  (See here: http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapPro_Multimaterials#Step_5_-_Registration for how to set the offsets.)

These offsets will be in the file prologue.gcode in the directory .reprap.old/Mendel-0.5mm (or whatever RepRap machine you are using).  Compare that file to the version in .reprap/Mendel-0.5mm (they are quite short).  Edit the new file to change the G10 lines to set the offsets for your machine.


Experiment with the source code
===============================

Make sure you have m2e installed (eclipse marketplace).

Import the slicer module as existing maven project. And run the main class org.reprap.Main as Java Application.


Binary Builds and Downloads
===========================

A build job is setup at cloudbees: https://xfd.ci.cloudbees.com/job/reprappro/

The latest build result is stored in this snapshot repository: https://repository-xfd.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/de/holger_oehm/reprap/host/slicer/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/

If you just want to use the binary without compiling it yourself, locate the file slicer-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar in the snapshot repository above, download it and run the slicer as follows:

 $ java -jar slicer-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar -Xmx1024M
